# Python-UDP-Chat-Room
A chat room using UDP in Python

## About the client
Notice that *udpclient.ini* is required. And *udpclient.ico* is recommended(to show the icon).  
Also note that the server will not know the client is exiting if you end the client process in the task manager, so this is **not** recommended.
